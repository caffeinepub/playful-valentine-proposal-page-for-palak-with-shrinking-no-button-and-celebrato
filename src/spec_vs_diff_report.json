  "summary": "Core Valentine page UI and celebratory Yes-state appear implemented with a warm Valentine palette and use of the specified image URLs, but the required generated image assets are not present in the diff and an unrequested backend canister plus unrequested auth/actor plumbing were added (also touching paths marked immutable).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the required generated images into the app as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and use them in the Valentine page layout.",
      "reason": "The Valentine page references the images by URL, but the diff does not show the required files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/ValentineProposalPage.tsx (references /assets/generated/valentine-bg.dim_1920x1080.png and /assets/generated/heart-doodle.dim_512x512.png)"

    {
      "description": "Added a backend canister file despite the request to keep the app frontend-only and not add backend services.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says to keep the app frontend-only unless explicitly required; diff adds backend code.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Added Internet Identity / actor + React Query plumbing (authentication-related infrastructure) even though authentication flows are a non-goal and not required for the Valentine page.",
      "reason": "Non-goals include Internet Identity login/auth flows; diff introduces InternetIdentityProvider, useInternetIdentity hook, and useActor hook with identity handling.",
